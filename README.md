# nginx-configs
This repository contains configuration templates for the Nginx web server. These
files may not work as is, and you may need to change various values according to
your setup and needs. Make sure to read the official Nginx documentations:
[this](https://www.nginx.org) and [this](https://www.nginx.com). I am merely dumping these in for reference.
